\title{Condition-adaptive fused graphical lasso}
\usage{
theta2rmat(theta, top_edge = NULL, min_edge = 0, keep.diag = F,
  verbose = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A list expression data which are n*p matrices. all matrices should have a same n and p.}

\item{lambda1}{The tuning parameter for the graphical lasso penalty.}

\item{lambda2}{The tuning parameter for the between condition group lasso penalty.}
}
\value{
\code{CFGL} produces a list that contains estimated inverse matrices and other necessary components.
}
\description{
The function jointly construct gene co-expression network for multiple class using Condition-adaptive Fused Graphical Lasso. Pairwise screening matrics are required to adjust between-condition lasso penalty.
